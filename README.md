# timsTOF immunopeptide prediction

Here you can find code developed to assess the new TOF Prosit 2023 model for the identification of immunopeptides measured on timsTOF instruments. More information can be found in the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.17.549401v1) named "Fragment ion intensity prediction improves the identification rate of non-tryptic peptides in TimsTOF".
